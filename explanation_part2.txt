`http://127.0.0.1:8000` is the *default* port that your backend API (from `bizzauto_api/main.py`) is configured to use if no `PORT` environment variable is set.

However, based on your initial logs, your backend is currently running on `http://127.0.0.1:49410`. This means that either the `PORT` environment variable was set to `49410` when the backend started, or it was assigned that port by the system.

For your frontend to correctly connect to your currently running backend, you *must* configure the frontend to point to `http://127.0.0.1:49410`.

As explained before, you need to create a `.env.local` file in your `bizz_autofinal_ui` directory (e.g., `E:\bizzauto-work\bizzauto-project\bizz_autofinal_ui\.env.local`) with the following content:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:49410
```

After creating this file, please restart your frontend development server for the changes to take effect.
