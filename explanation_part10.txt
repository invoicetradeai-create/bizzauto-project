I have applied the necessary fixes to `bizzauto_api/routers/api/companies.py` and `bizzauto_api/routers/api/users.py` based on the `crud.py` function signatures.

Specifically, I have:
*   **For `companies.py`**: Reverted the `read_companies` function to its original state, removing the `user: User = Depends(get_current_user)` dependency and the `user_id` argument from the `get_companies` call. The `db: Session = Depends(set_rls_context)` dependency remains as it sets the RLS context for the session.
*   **For `users.py`**: Reverted the `read_users` function to use `db: Session = Depends(get_db)`, removed the `user: User = Depends(get_current_user)` dependency and the `user_id` argument from the `get_users` call. Also, removed `set_rls_context` from the imports as it is not used in this file.

These changes should resolve the `TypeError` you encountered for `get_companies()` and the `405 Method Not Allowed` error for `GET /api/users`.

Please restart your backend application (if it's running locally) or redeploy it (if it's on Render) and then retest these API endpoints. You should now be able to successfully perform `GET` requests on them.

Let me know if you encounter any further issues.
