I have applied the necessary fixes to `bizzauto_api/routers/api/invoices.py`, `bizzauto_api/routers/api/products.py`, and `bizzauto_api/routers/api/companies.py`.

Specifically, I have:
*   **For `invoices.py`**: Re-added `db: Session = Depends(set_rls_context)` and `user: User = Depends(get_current_user)` to the `read_invoices` function and updated it to fetch invoices from the database using these dependencies.
*   **For `products.py`**: Changed `db: Session = Depends(get_db)` to `db: Session = Depends(set_rls_context)` in the `read_products` function.
*   **For `companies.py`**: Added `from dependencies import set_rls_context, get_current_user` and `from sql_models import User`. Changed `db: Session = Depends(get_db)` to `db: Session = Depends(set_rls_context)` and added `user: User = Depends(get_current_user)` to the `read_companies` function, updating it to fetch companies from the database using these dependencies.

These changes should resolve the `405 Method Not Allowed` errors for `GET` requests to `/api/invoices`, `/api/products`, and `/api/companies`.

Please restart your backend application (if it's running locally) or redeploy it (if it's on Render) and then retest these API endpoints. You should now be able to successfully perform `GET` requests on them.
