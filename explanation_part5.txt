Thank you for providing the backend API URL: `https://bizzauto-project.onrender.com`.

To ensure your deployed frontend (`bizz_autofinal_ui`) connects correctly to your deployed backend, you need to set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` environment variable within your frontend's *production environment configuration* on Render.

For local development, you would use a `.env.local` file. For deployment on platforms like Render, you typically configure these environment variables directly in the Render dashboard for your frontend service, or by including a `.env` file in your repository if Render is configured to pick it up.

You need to ensure that the `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` environment variable for your `bizz_autofinal_ui` project on Render is set to:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://bizzauto-project.onrender.com
```

After setting this environment variable in your Render service settings for the frontend, you will need to redeploy your frontend application for the changes to take effect.

This will ensure that when your frontend application builds and runs on Render, it knows to make API calls to your deployed backend at `https://bizzauto-project.onrender.com`.
