I have added the missing import statement for `set_rls_context` in `bizzauto_api/routers/api/inventory.py`.

Specifically, I added:
`from dependencies import set_rls_context` (and ensured `get_current_user` was also imported from `dependencies`).

This should resolve the `NameError: name 'set_rls_context' is not defined` you encountered.

Please restart your backend application (if it's running locally) or redeploy it (if it's on Render) and then retest the API endpoints.

Let me know if you encounter any further issues.
