feat: Implement dynamic greeting, responsive invoice page, and modal

This commit introduces several features and responsiveness improvements:

- **Dashboard Dynamic Greeting:**
  - Implemented a time-based greeting message (Good Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night) on the dashboard.
  - Corrected time ranges for greetings to match specified requirements.

- **Invoice Page Responsiveness (Force-Fix):**
  - Refactored the invoice listing page (`invoices/page.tsx`) for full responsiveness across mobile, tablet, and desktop.
  - Desktop layout is preserved (centered, max-w-1100px, normal spacing).
  - Mobile/tablet layouts are fully responsive:
    - Table no longer stacks rows on mobile; instead, it uses horizontal scroll (`overflow-x-auto`, `whitespace-nowrap`).
    - Invoice ID and Client ID columns use `break-all` for long text.
    - Responsive container widths: mobile (full width), md (max-w-90%), lg/xl (max-w-1100px).
    - Search bar and Add button align horizontally on desktop, stack vertically on mobile.
    - Improved spacing, padding, and font sizes for mobile/tablet without affecting desktop.

- **Create Invoice Modal Responsiveness:**
  - Switched from Shadcn `Sheet` to `Dialog` component for the "Create Invoice" modal to ensure it is properly centered.
  - Implemented full responsiveness for the modal (`InvoiceForm` component):
    - Desktop: centered, max-w-xl/2xl, spacious layout.
    - Mobile/Tablet: full screen width, reduced padding, full-width inputs/dropdowns/textareas, vertically stacked buttons.
    - Added a subtle vertical gap under the Client ID input field.
  - Added `dialog.tsx` component to `components/ui/` as it was missing.

- **Sign Up Auto-Verification:**
  - Modified frontend signup logic to remove email verification redirection and update success message, enabling immediate sign-in after registration.
  - Backend already defaults new users to 'active' status.
