Please try these steps carefully to ensure your local development environment is using the latest code:

1.  **Stop your development server.** If your application is currently running, go to the terminal where you started it (e.g., with `npm run dev`) and press `Ctrl+C` to stop it.

2.  **Delete the Next.js build cache.** This ensures no old code is being used.
    *   Open your terminal and navigate to the `bizz_autofinal_ui` directory:
        `cd bizz_autofinal_ui`
    *   Then, run the following command (since you are on Windows):
        `rmdir /s /q .next`

3.  **Restart your development server.**
    *   While still in the `bizz_autofinal_ui` directory in your terminal, run:
        `npm run dev`

After completing these steps, please open your browser and navigate to the settings page. Let me know if the `405` error is still appearing in your browser's developer console.
