You've encountered an `Exception in ASGI application`. The provided traceback is truncated, so I cannot see the specific error or where it's happening in your `bizzauto_api` code.

Please provide the *full* traceback, including the specific error message and any lines that point to files within your `bizzauto_api` directory. This will help me pinpoint the exact issue.
