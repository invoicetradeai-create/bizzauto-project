    # The user's log shows: 'phone': '' in JWT, but they are sending TO a number.
    # I'll just hardcode a likely number or ask the user. 
    # Actually, I can't easily know the number without asking.
    # I will try to send to the number that failed in the log if I can see it?
    # The log doesn't show the 'to' number in the error message.
    
    # I will create a script that tries to send 'hello_world' to a hardcoded number 
    # but I don't have a number.
    # I will instead create a script that the user can run, or I will just modify the code to try hello_world temporarily.

# The error is specific: "template name (expense_report) does not exist in en_US"
# This means the API call is reaching Meta, but Meta can't find the template in that locale.
